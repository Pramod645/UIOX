/*
On a time sharing system, the kernel allocates the CPU to a process for a period of
time called a time slice or time quantum, preempts the process and schedules
another one when the time slice expires, and reschedules the process to continue
execution at a later time.
The scheduler function on the system uses
relative time of execution as a parameter to determine which process to schedule
next. Every active process has a scheduling priority; the kernel switches context to
that of the process with the highest priority when it does a context switch. The
kernel recalculates the priority of the running process when it returns from kernel
mode to user mode, and it periodically readjusts the priority of every "ready-toÂ·
run" process in user mode.
//Each occurrence of a clock interrupt is called a clock tick .
*/
/*
//The scheduler on the UNIX system belongs to the general class of operating system
schedulers known as round robin with multilevel feedback, meaning that the kernel
allocates the CPU to a process for a time quantum, preempts a process that exceeds
its time quantum, and feeds it back into one of several priority queues. A process
may need many iterations through the "feedback loop" before it finishes. When
the kernel does a context switch and restores the context of a process, the process
resumes execution from the point where it had been suspended.
