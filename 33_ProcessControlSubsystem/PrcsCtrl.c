/*
The fork system call creates a new process, the exit call terminates process execution, and the wait call allows a parent process
to synchronize its execution with the exit of a child process. Signals inform processes of asynchronous events. Because the kernel synchronizes execution of
exit and wait via signals, the chapter presents signals before exit and wait . The exec system call allows a process to invoke a .. new" program, overlaying its address space with the executable image of a file. The brk system call allows a process to allocate more memory dynamically; similarly, the system allows the user stack to grow dynamically by allocating more space when necessary, using the same mechanisms as for brk .

//Almost all calls use sleep and wakeup
//exec interacts with the file system algorithms

//Signals inform processes of the occurrence of asynchronous events
//Processes may send each other signals with the kill system call, or the kernel may send signals internally. There are 19 signals in the System V UNIX system that can be classified as follows
1.Signals having to do with the termination of a process, sent when a process exits or when a process invokes the signal system call with the death of child parameter;
2.Signals having to do with process induced exceptions such as when a process accesses an address outside its virtual address space, when it attempts to write
memory that is read-only (such as program text) , or when it executes a privileged instruction or for various hardware errors;
3.Signals having to do with the unrecoverable conditions during a system call, such as running out of system resources during exec after the original address
space has been released
4.Signals caused by an unexpected error condition during a system call, such as making a nonexistent system call  , writing a pipe that has no reader
processes, or using an illegal "reference" value for the /seek system call. It would be more consistent to return an error on such system calls instead of
generating a signal, but the use of signals to abort misbehaving processes is more pragmatic;
5.Signals originating from a process in user mode, such as When a process wishes to receive an alarm signal after_ a period of time, 0( when processes send
arbitrary signals to each other with the kill system call;
6.Signals related to terminal interaction such as when a user hangs up a terminal or when a user presses the "break" or "delete" keys on a terminal keyboard;
7.Signals for tracing execution of a process.

// system boot and the init process
//To initialize a system from an inactive state, an administrator goes through a
"bootstrap" sequence: The administrator "boots" the system. Boot procedures
vary according to machine type, but the goal is common to all machines: to get a
copy of the operating system into machine memory and to start executing it. This
is usually done in a series of stages; hence the name bootstrap. The administrator
may set switches on the computer console to specify the address of a special hardcoded
bootstrap program or just push a single button that instructs the machine to
load a bootstrap program from its microcode. This program may consist of only a
few instructions that instruct the machine to execute another program.
//the bootstrap procedure eventually reads the boot block (block 0) of a
disk, and loads it into memory. The program contained in the boot block loads the
kernel from the file system
//After the kernel is loaded in memory, the boot
program transfers control to the start address of the kernel, and the kernel st<1rts

//in the system are either user processes, daemon processes, orkernel processes.

//Most processes on typical systems are user processes, associated with users at a terminal
//Daemon processes are not associated with any users but
do system-wide functions, such as administration and control of networks, execution
of time-dependent activities, line printer spooling, and so on. /nit may spawn
daemon processes that exist throughout the lifetime of the system or, on occasion,
users may spawn them. They are like user processes in that they run at user mode
and make system calls to access system services.
//Kernel processes execute only in kernel mode. Process 0 spawns kernel
processes, such as the page-reclaiming process vhand, and then becomes the
swapper process. Kernel processes are similar to daemon processes in that they
provide system-wide services, but they have greater control over their execution
priorities since their code is part of the kernel. They can access kernel algorithms
and data structures directly without the use of system calls, so they are extremely
powerful. However, they are not as flexible as daetnon processes, because the
kernel must be recompiled to change them.
