1 . The process is executing in user mode.
2. The process is executing in kernel mode.
3. The process is not executing but is ready to run as soon as the kernel schedules it .
4 . The process is sleeping and resides in main memory.
5. The process is ready to run, but the swapper (process 0) must swap the process into main memory before the kernel can schedule it to execute.
 will reconsider this state in a paging system.
6. The process is sleeping, and the swapper has swapped the process to secondary storage to make room for other processes in main memory.
7 . The process is returning from the kernel to user mode, but the kernel preempts it and does a context switch to schedule another process. The
distinction between this state and state 3 ("ready to run") will be brought out shortly.
8 . The process i s newly created and is in a transition state; the process exists, 
but it is not ready to run, nor is it sleeping. This state is the start state for all processes except process 0.
9 . The process executed the exit system call and is in the zombie state. The process no longer exists, but it leaves a record containing an exit code and
some timing statistics for its Â· parent process to collect. The zombie state is the final state of a process.
